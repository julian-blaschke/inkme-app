## Idea

artists can share their art either via posts or for a limited time in their, or their shop's stories. Every artist attends at least 1 shop in a certain role (owner, partner, apprentice,...) and can have guest spots at other shops after they were invited to do so. Shared art is tagged with the shop it was made at, to add it to the shops timeline. To help create a profile of an artist's specialties, posts are also tagged with the style it was done in (black and gray, new-school, Japanese, ...). 

Users can subscribe to both individual artists and shops, to always stay up to date on their posts, or just explore artists they would like working with. The `discover` section of this service can suggest and inspire both artists and customers with work they are interested in, by analyzing subscription behavior. To save art you like for later, you can add posts to collections in your library.
